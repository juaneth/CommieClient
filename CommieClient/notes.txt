For library I could make a folder with the game id and other info like startup path then do that, maybe do the same for favouriting stuff too

Downloading system might be a bit complex though, since i want a way to have multiple downloads happening at once (maybe not for vimm downloads though since those will fail)
plus idk about speed for downloading things so we'll have to see!

The store is a bit tricky for the UI but the main idea is pretty simple, i just need to count how many games there are in the repo and divide it by maybe 10 to get the page numbers, then go through and add a thumbnail for it with a title, simple picturebox and label. wont be pretty for a while
