## Build Instructions

Download the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/juaneth/CommieClient/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and open with Visual Studio (make sure you have .NET Desktop Development), then once its all loaded click 'Build' and then 'Build Solution'

To access the built application, go to wherever you have the downloaded project and go to 'CommieClient/bin/debug/net5.0-windows/'

To make this functional and not break upon launch you should make a couple files, one called 'cfg.comclient' and one called 'savedrepo.comclient' then open 'cfg.comclient' with notepad or any text editor, then put 'FirstTime= 0' inside the file and then you should be good to go! Open up CommieClient.exe and it should work like normal
