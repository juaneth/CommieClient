# Build Instructions

## Download the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/juaneth/CommieClient/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and open with Visual Studio (make sure you have .NET ## Desktop Development), then once its all loaded click 'Build' and then 'Build Solution'

## To access the built application, go to wherever you have the downloaded project and go to 'CommieClient/bin/debug/net5.0-windows/'

## To make this functional and not break upon launch you should download the 'test release' [here](https://github.com/juaneth/CommieClient/releases/download/0.0.0/comclient-x64.zip) and then replace the files inside there with the ones you have made
