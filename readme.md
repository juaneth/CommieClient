## Build Instructions

Download the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/juaneth/CommieClient/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and import to Visual Studio (make sure you have .NET Desktop Development) and open up the project, then on the top bar click 'Build'  and then 'Build Solution'

To access the built application, go to wherever you have the downloaded project and go to 'CommieClient/bin/debug/net5.0-windows/'

To make this functional and not break upon launch you should make a file called 'cfg.comclient' in this folder and open it with notepad or any text editor, then put 'FirstTime= 0' inside the file and you should be good to go! Open up CommieClient.exe and it should work like normal
